Procrastinator Persona (Brendan):

Gabi, age 20, is a student at Temple University and is an innate procrastinator. She grew up with high expectations placed on her, so she expects a lot of herself especially with regards to her academics. She also knows the value of a mental health break, which she abuses as an excuse to put off her work until the last minute. However, she always gets it done, even if it means sacrificing her sleep. She is very comfortable with technology and knows how to navigate the Temple specific websites and apps (e.g. Canvas, TUPortal) with ease â€“ a skill she learned a result of submitting assignments at 11:58 P.M. 

If she can manage to get a room at the library, it often helps with her productivity. However, she finds that often her procrastination leads to most, if not all, of the rooms being booked before she even gets the chance to try. Gabi believes The Library Room Auto-scheduler would be a fantastic tool for her to get access to rooms before the masses. However, she worries that she may even procrastinate using the scheduler, and find herself trying to schedule a room at 11:59 the night before she uses the room.
