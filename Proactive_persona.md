**Proactive Student Persona (Guthrie):**

Michelle, 19, is a second year student at temple university but is technically a junior because 
she got a 5 on every AP test offered at her high school. She is a bio major and Is currently taking 
O-chem 2 but she doesn’t have to put much work into it because she read the textbook and did all the 
practice questions over winter break. She sleeps 8 hours a night, works out at 6 in the morning everyday, 
and hasn’t eaten fast food since 2014. She is comfortable navigating the tuportal but doesn’t like it at 
all (she thinks its slow, ugly, and generally outdated). 

As a bio major Michelle is constantly memorizing things and studying. She is a calculated person and an intense 
planner. She plans her outfits for the week every Sunday night, meal preps, and budgets her money down to the penny. 
Michelle is an extrovert and can’t stand to sit in her dorm doing work which leads to long hours in the tech center 
and the Library. She would much rather study with a group of a few close peers than by herself. The fact that she can 
only schedule rooms a couple days in advance gives her anxiety and really messes up her weekly scheduling. She has 
emailed the library staff multiple times asking them to change their scheduling policy but they will not.
