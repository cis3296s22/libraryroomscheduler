# New Student User Persona

Josh, age 18, is a new freshman to Temple University. He comes from a small town in rural Pennsylvania, so the change to a big city is a little bit of a culture shock to him. Josh is majoring in math - it comes naturally to him - but he'd like to explore some more creative channels too. He is comfortable using his iPhone for the basics: texting, social media, etc. but doesn't feel the need to learn the more in-depth things that would label him as a "pwer user."

Much of the navigation in the TUPortal is still confusing to Josh. He'd like to be able to book one of the rooms at the library, as it offers some more space and is quieter than his dorm room. But, by the time he's able to find where to book a room, everything is booked. Josh believes his lack of navigational awareness is slowing him down; he is very interested in using the Library Room Auto-Scheduler to be able to book a room before they all become unavailable.
